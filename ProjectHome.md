# Project overview #

As the the name itself suggests, this project is a HTTP server. But it can serve not only static HTML pages. The main purpose is to provide a possibility to serve dynamic (_dynamic_ in terms of the content) pages. In other words, you never know what you will get ;)

The aim of the project is to create a framework that would enable to write web sites that are capable of interacting with the user, for example by processing user forms and/or uploading files.

The idea behind this project is similar to the one of Java Servlets. Nevertheless, this project does not attempt to be a port of this technology to C++ and does not base of any Servlets code / classes. All similarities are accidental.

## Goals ##
  * Http server serving both static and dynamic pages
  * support for forms - reading fields and uploading files
  * a set of libraries that enable writing custom web modules
  * some sample web modules presenting features of the server
  * support for persistent Http connections

## Tools ##
The whole project is created by means of the **Qt framework**. The code is written and debugged using provided **Qt Creator**. We have decided to port the project to **Qt5**, so that make sure you have the right version of the libraries.

Development and testing is performed on the **Linux** operating system (Ubuntu, should anyone be curious). I also use **Firefox** to check everything goes as expected.

# Documentation #
Here I need to be honest - the documentation is not my priority. This means some documents may become outdated. Nevertheless, I'll try to do my best.

# Introduction #

Version 0.2 is now (i.e. end of 2012) out !


# Installation #

Please refer to ReleaseV01 for the installation instructions, replacing 0.1 with 0.2 when appropriate.

# Running & Testing #

After starting the server, in the top-right corner there is a _Start server_ button. After pressing it, the server will listen on the configured interface / port (see below).

By default it listens on localhost and port 9090.

To test the server visit the following links:
  * http://localhost:9090 - you should see a simple static page loaded from a html file
  * http://localhost:9090/fortune-cookie - this is a dynamic page prepared by the fortune-teller plugin.
  * http://localhost:9090/image-gallery - this is a dynamic page prepared by the fortune-teller plugin.

# Configuration file #

The SJ Http Server uses a configuration file, _sj-http-server.ini_. Settings can be also modified via the GUI.
